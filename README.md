#### For students:
  - Get token from your teacher.
  - Open chat with [labot](https://t.me/bauman_code_games_bot).

  - Choose available option of your task.

#### Why should I use **labot**?
It is common situation that teacher prepares limited number of slots per option, so it is important to give students "clear" choice of option.
**labot**'s architecture respects the time of got request. Now the choice of an option does not depend on internet connection! The fastest students can get the most interesting options.
